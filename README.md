## 📌 Current Use

EvoX Engine is currently being developed as the foundation for an isometric mouse-driven survival game called **Hexbound**. While its long-term goal is to evolve into a standalone engine usable across multiple 2D projects, its first real-world application will be **Hexbound**, where its core systems will be tested and refined.

After **Hexbound** reaches a stable milestone, EvoX will be extracted into its own repository and maintained as a separate open-source game engine.

## ⚠️ Early Development

EvoX Engine is in active development. While many systems are still in progress, the engine structure is being designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. Expect frequent changes and improvements as development continues.
